## Config
<ul>

</ul>

## Instructions
After you started the script, go and focus on Roblox window.<br>Make sure your resolution is set to 1920x1080 and Roblox is in fullscreen.<br>Open quests tab and add 3 quests on top.<br>Make sure you can roll the minimum amount of chests per quest in config before starting it.<br>After you started it with your keybind, let it run till it stops.<br>If you experience any issues, or setted minimum chests to a too high amount, press <code>END</code> to turn off the script

## Disclaimers
Script can sometimes skip a good roll or dont recognize the quest content, it's AI. However try to increase delay in config if you feel like its skipping too much.
